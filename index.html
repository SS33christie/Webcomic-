    <h1>Welcome to My Webcomic!</h1>
    <p>My webcomic is about daily stories I've collected that are warm, fun, or simply remind me of things. </p>
    <p>It's a bit casual since I'm still learning how to narrate and write. </p>
    <p>The story follows a dog that was lost and later found again, inspired by a cute story from a friend. </p>
    <p>The puppy was sweet, well-behaved, and innocentâ€”until one day, it got lost. Follow along! </p>
